## Description:
A React SPA web development portfolio built with React and CoreUI. 



## Technologies
The portfolio is a single page application, with react-router controlling the rendering of each component. A reusable project component allow for the easy addition of future projects and more DRY code.



## Deployment:
The app is deployed on [Github](
https://kait-weishaar.github.io/fluffy-chainsaw/)
